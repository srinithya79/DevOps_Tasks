ELB - Elastic load balancer

on multiple server "myapp" will run
for elb - domain name(DNS) will be given automatically by AWS while creating the load balancer

ASG - Auto Scaling Group (if threashold limit crossed means asg will create one new machine and after that it will terminate)
cpu utilizaion crossed means automatically asg will create one machine
user data loads over 


we can create ELB in 4 methods
Application Load Balancer - works according to path (microservice)  -- first need to bring register target first then only can able to create load balancer 
Network Load balancer - works using protocol (microservice)  -- first need to bring register target first then only can able to create load balancer 
Gateway Load balancer  				(microservice) -- first need to bring register target first then only can able to create load balancer 
Classic Load balancer - works in round robin system (monolithic)  -- directly connect the ELB


Application Engineering - 
what is monolithic - single layer of architecture
what is microservice - multi layer of architecture


diff between internet & intranet
internet - works globally
intranet - works within the community (like within office environment)

diff between template message & normal message
template message - pre-defined message & it is reusable
normal message - 

userdata -- 

Via auto sclaing - Launch configuration -- can create a template and it is reusable

For create autoscaling/classic load balancer steps
----------------------
1. CLB
2. select Template
3. Attached template 
4. set max and mini capacity

*****ASG automatically creates and terminates the instance according to the traffic in instances****

For ALB need 2 servers
need to set target group for ALB
