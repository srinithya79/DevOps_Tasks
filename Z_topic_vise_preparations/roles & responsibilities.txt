The typical DevOps workflow is as follows:
Atlassian Jira for writing requirements and tracking tasks.
Based on the Jira tasks, developers checking code into GIT version control system.
The code checked into GIT is built by using Apache Maven.
The build process is automated with Jenkins.
During the build process, automated tests run to validate the code checked in by a
developer.
Code built on Jenkins is sent to organizationâ€™s Artifactory.
Jenkins automatically picks the libraries from Artifactory and deploys it to Production.
During Production deployment, Docker images are used to deploy same code on
multiple hosts.
Once a code is deployed to Production, we use monitoring tools like ngios are
used to check the health of production servers.
Splunk based alerts inform the admins of any issues or exceptions in production.

****1. Software Installation
primarily will be installing the softwares

****2. Infra setup
If new servers are coming up in ur applications has to be deployed in ur environment,  devops has responsible for managing the setup

****3. Server Maintains
If any server goes down, we need to add on multiple resources like increasing number of cpu's, amount of RAM, like additional disks, association.

****4. Application Support
If any application stops working in SIT(System Integration Tests), it may be in dev servers, or sometime production as well, devops is responsible for provide that as well.

****5. Version Control Support
providing access to devlopers based on their requirements 
that could be on specific branch 
that could be on specific repository
or like if any person wants to access on entire project so that is also possible that is what devops team manages


****6. Build and release
- first of all requirements comes to developer 
- for requirement gathering we use confluence page
- for tracking purpose we use JIRA because whenever requirement comes a ticket is created on JIRA and that is assigned to developer
- developer works on multiple IDE's which can be vscode, eclipse, maven, gradle
- once developer commits the code
- 



*****7. Automation


****8. VA/PT Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing
weather your infrastructure is secure or not
if it is secure then devops team helps operation team to produce this report 
if there are some bugs, there are some patches to be deploy then devops team perform the activity

****9. Documentation



****10. Support Cross Functions Team
DevOps team supports to developers while setting up IDE (Vscode, eclipse, maven, griddle)
when they need access or any connectivity issues 


****11. Research and Deploy New Tools



****12. Resource Enablement
