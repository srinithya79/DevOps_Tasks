*******1. Storage class
Amazon S3 offers a range of storage classes designed for different use cases. These include S3 Standard for general-purpose storage of frequently accessed data; S3 Intelligent-Tiering for data with unknown or changing access patterns; 

S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) and S3 One Zone-Infrequent Access (S3 One Zone-IA) for long-lived, but less frequently accessed data; and Amazon S3 Glacier (S3 Glacier) and Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive (S3 Glacier Deep Archive) for long-term archive and digital preservation. 

If you have data residency requirements that can’t be met by an existing AWS Region, you can use the S3 Outposts storage class to store your S3 data on-premises. Amazon S3 also offers capabilities to manage your data throughout its lifecycle. Once an S3 Lifecycle policy is set, your data will automatically transfer to a different storage class without any changes to your application.  




********2. purpose of using s3 in your project
To used s3 to store dump files, logs of bigger size etc,.


********3. How to do "cors" region replication
Cross-Region Replication allows you to replicate data between distant AWSRegions to satisfy these requirements. 
Minimize latency — If your customers are in two geographic locations, you can minimize latency in accessing objects by maintaining object copies in AWS Regions that are geographically closer to your users.



********4. S3 Bucket copy
Create a new S3 bucket.
Install and configure the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI).
Copy the objects between the S3 buckets. ...
Verify that the objects are copied.
Update existing API calls to the target bucket name.


*******5. lifecycle policy
Amazon S3 lifecycle configuration rules, you can significantly reduce your storage costs by automatically transitioning data from one storage class to another or even automatically delete data after a period of time.
- Store backup data initially in Amazon S3 Standard
- After 30 days, transition to Amazon Standard IA
- After 90 days, transition to Amazon Glacier
- After 3 years, delete


*******6. bucket permission
--S3

By default, all S3 buckets, objects and related sub resources are private.
User is the AWS Account or the IAM user who access the resource.
Bucket owner is the AWS account that created a bucket.
Object owner is the AWS account that uploads the object to a bucket, not owned by the account.
 
Access my S3 bucket
 
S3 buckets are private and can be accessed only by users that are explicitly granted access. When using AWS, it's a best practice to restrict access to your resources to the people that absolutely need it.
