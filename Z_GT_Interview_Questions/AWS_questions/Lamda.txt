1. Why we are going to serverless
https://stackify.com/aws-lambda-serverless/

A serverless compute Environment to host and run your Application Code

1.Only needs a Bug free working application code
2.Service is payable only for to/fro compute time (number of hits & app connections
3.Needs a Lambda Function which is invoked to run your application code

Runtime
Languages Supported by Lambda :
C#/PowerShell
Go
Java
Nod e .js
Python
Ruby


2. serverless vs Ec2



3. lambda purpose in your project
- In our project.... We have several dev instances running... Developers won't use those in weekends... 
- So we use lambda to stop those dev instances using tags on Friday evening 9 and will start at Monday morning 6....
- We use lambda function to do that.... 
- We will create a rule in cloud watch with target as the lambda function and give cron expression so that it will execute the lambda function on that particular time and stop and start those instances
- And we also we use lambda for event driven functions. We set these events based up on the project requirements.. for example: if some file comes on the particular bucket. We need to copy that file in to another bucket and also need to send notification... 
- So i write lambda function to trigger those events.


4. lambda max timeout
15 minutes
You can now configure your AWS Lambda functions to run up to 15 minutes per execution. Previously, the maximum execution time (timeout) for a Lambda function was 5 minutes.



5. for what application you used in lambda
using java
