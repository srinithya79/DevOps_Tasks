*****1. Purpose of Route53
Is a highly available and scalable Domain Name service offered by AWS. You could purchase a domain through AWS or from any other domain seller and have route 53 setup as the default DNS routing platform to reach that site. Route 53 also facilitates routing requests to any AWS resource such as S3 or EC2 instances etc.

when used:
The Route 53 is the first component in any AWS Architecture. It does pure DNS route and hence different from Load balancer or Autoscaling since it does not manage workload or trigger any scale up actions

*****3. Policy of Route 53
The routing policies available in Amazon Route53 are
- Simple
- Weighted
- Latency Based
- Failover
- Geolocation

When you create a record, you choose a routing policy, which determines how Amazon Route 53 responds to queries:

Simple routing policy — Use for a single resource that performs a given function for your domain, for example, a web server that serves content for the example.com website.

Weighted routing policy — Use to route traffic to multiple resources in proportions that you specify.

Latency routing policy — Use when you have resources in multiple AWS Regions and you want to route traffic to the region that provides the best latency.

Failover routing policy — Use when you want to configure active-passive failover.

Geolocation routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your users.

Geoproximity routing policy — Use when you want to route traffic based on the location of your resources and, optionally, shift traffic from resources in one location to resources in another.

Multivalue answer routing policy — Use when you want Route 53 to respond to DNS queries with up to eight healthy records selected at random.
