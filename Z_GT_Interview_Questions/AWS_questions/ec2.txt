********2. Lost pem file
Accessing the EC2 instance even if you loose the pem file is rather easy.
- First, create a new instance by creating new access file, call it 'helper' instance with same region and VPC as of the lost pem file instance.
- Now stop the lost pem file instance. Remember not to terminate instance but to stop it.
- Go to EBS volumes, select the root volume of the lost pem file instance and detach.
- Now again select the detached volume and this time you have to attach this volume to helper instance which we created before. Since helper instance already has a root volume by default as /dev/sda1, the newly attached volume will be secondary(eg: /dev/sdf).

- Login to your helper instance with its pem file.

Execute below commands:
# mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt
# cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /mnt/root/.ssh/
# umount /mnt

- Detach the secondary volume from helper instance.
- Again attach the volume back to our recovery instance. Start the instance. Terminate the helper instance.
- Use helper instance pem file to log into recovery instance.



********3. AMI vs Ec2  vs Snapshot
AMI is (snapshot + machine/hardware metadata). EBS Volume is the underlying disk behind EC2. Snapshot is a point in time backup of specific volume while AMI is backup of the entire EC2 instance that might have multiple attached volumes, exactly like virtual machine.
- EBS Snapshot very often represents a backup of specific EBS volume, it might be any volume (Root volume, data volume, etc.)
- AMI (Amazon Machine Image) is a backup of Entire EC2 instance. For example, with proper configuration it's possible to create AMI which includes multiple EBS volumes.
 
- EBS Snapshot is a just a data backup.
- AMI is a representation of system state at specific time. You can also boot from it.

********5. Increase volume
Expand the EBS root volume of EC2 Linux running on a current generation instance without detaching and reattaching the volume by using the Amazon EBS Elastic Volumes feature. 
To expand the EBS root volume of EC2 Linux running on a previous generation instance, you must detach and then reattach the volume
