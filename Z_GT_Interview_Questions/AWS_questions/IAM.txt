****1. Role & Policy
Roles are for AWS services, Where we can assign permission of some AWS service to other Service.
- Giving S3 permission to EC2 to access S3 Bucket Contents.
- Policies are for users and groups, where we can assign permissions to u.
- Giving permission to user to access the S3 buckets.


******2. access to another account
Permission to an IAM user

- Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the IAM console at https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/ .
Choose Users in the navigation pane, choose the name of the user whose permissions you want to modify, and then choose the Permissions tab.

- Choose Add permissions, and then choose Copy permissions from existing user.




*****3. Inline policy

An Inline Policy is an IAM policy which is actually embedded within the user, group, or role to which it applies. There is a strict 1:1 relationship between the entity and the policy.

When you delete the user, group, or role in which the Inline policy is embedded, the policy will also be deleted.

In most cases, AWS recommends using Managed Policies over Inline Policies.

Inline Policies are useful when you want to be sure that the permissions in a policy are not inadvertently assigned to any other user, group, or role than the one for which they're intended (i.e. you are creating a policy that must only ever be attached to a single user, group, or role).
